"""
Custom Django management command to seed initial data.

This command populates:
- Products (with descriptions)
- Stock balances (default quantities)
- Delivery slots (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

Usage:
    python manage.py seed_products

This is useful for:
- Initial setup of the application
- Demo/testing environments
- Ensuring Ops managers always have baseline data

Following assignment requirements:
- At least 5â€“10 products must exist in local DB/mocks.
- Stock balances should be updated twice daily (Ops will later update).
- Delivery slots must exist for customers to choose from.
